    "Welcome to *Prompt Engineering with LLaMA-2*!\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering drastically increases the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with little effort. With a robust prompt engineering toolkit at your disposal you can customize LLM behavior to perform a diverse set of tasks and get more out of LLMs regardless of their size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will interact with and prompt engineer LLaMA-2 models to analyze documents, generate text, and be an AI assistant. By the time you complete this course you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iteratively write precise prompts to bring LLM behavior in line with your intentions.\n",
    "- Leverage editing the powerful system message.\n",
    "- Guide LLMs with one-to-many shot prompt engineering.\n",
    "- Incorporate prompt-response history into the LLM context to create chatbot behavior."

    "1. **Introduction**: This notebook.\n",
    "1. **Iterative Prompt Development**: In this notebook we iterate on a set of simple prompts, familiarizing ourselves with the transformers pipeline and LLaMA-2 models we will be using throughout the course. We will learn the importance of **precise** prompts.\n",
    "1. **Star Bikes Product Review Analyst**: In this notebook you'll build an AI-powered document analyst for a fictitious bicycle company and learn how to perform **few-shot learning**.\n",
    "1. **Star Bikes Marketing Copy Generator**: In this notebook you will build an AI-powered marketing copy writer, capable to perform a number of generative tasks and learn how to provide and leverage **system context**.\n",
    "1. **Random Personas**: In this notebook you will create unique AI personalities by learning to enable **sampling** and control the **temperature** of the model's generation.\n",
    "1. **Chatbot**: In this notebook you will begin to create chatbot functionality, creating an chatbot capable of retaining conversation history.\n",
    "1. **Star Bikes AI Assistant**: In this notebook you'll make an AI assistant to help customers make the best decision about getting a new bike from Star Bikes, and will learn about working with a model's **token limits**.\n",
    "1. **Conclusion**: In this notebook you will review everthing you learned in the course, and get some guidance about logical next steps for your learning."
